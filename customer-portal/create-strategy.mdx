## Getting to the Strategy Creation

There are two ways to start creating a strategy. Pick the flow that matches your current state:

      <Step title="Click on the 'Get Started' button">
        From your main dashboard, click on the 'Get Started' button.

      </Step>
      <Step title="Enter a name for your first strategy">
        <Note>

      </Step>
      <Step title="Select the assets you want to support">
        Select the assets you want to support.

        <Note>
          The assets you select here determine which tokens your users will be able to deposit into your strategy to earn yield.
          For example, if you select USDC and SOL, your users can deposit USDC or SOL and earn yield on their deposits.

      </Step>
      <Step title="Set up the fee distribution wallet">
        Enter the Solana wallet address where you want to receive the fees from your strategy.

      </Step>
      <Step title="Configure the fee percentage for your strategy">

        <img src="/customer-portal/images/strategy-creation/first-strategy/onboarding-fee-percentage.png" alt="Set Up Fee Distribution" />

        <Warning>
          **How fees work:**

          The fee you set is taken **only from the yield earned by your users**, not from their deposits.

          For example, if you set a 10% fee and your user earns 100 USD in yield, you will receive 10 USD as your fee. The user keeps 90 USD of their earned yield, and their original deposit remains untouched.
        </Warning>
      </Step>
      <Step title="Click the 'Continue' button">
        This will take you to setting up your API keys
