# Breeze Agent Kit

The Breeze Agent Kit is a comprehensive toolkit that gives AI agents the ability to interact with Solana yield strategies. Deposit, withdraw, check balances, and earn yield — all through a simple interface your agent already understands.

## MCP Integration

The fastest way to connect an AI agent to Breeze. Works with Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, and any MCP-compatible client.

### Prerequisites

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get your API key">
    Sign up and grab your `BREEZE_API_KEY` from [portal.breeze.baby](https://portal.breeze.baby).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Export your wallet key">
    Export your Solana private key as a base58 string for `WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY`.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Configuration

Add the following to your MCP client configuration file:

<CodeGroup>

```json macOS
// ~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "breeze": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@breezebaby/mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "BREEZE_API_KEY": "your-api-key",
        "WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY": "your-base58-private-key",
        "SOLANA_RPC_URL": "https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

```json Windows
// %APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "breeze": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@breezebaby/mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "BREEZE_API_KEY": "your-api-key",
        "WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY": "your-base58-private-key",
        "SOLANA_RPC_URL": "https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

```json Linux
// ~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "breeze": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@breezebaby/mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "BREEZE_API_KEY": "your-api-key",
        "WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY": "your-base58-private-key",
        "SOLANA_RPC_URL": "https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

</CodeGroup>

Restart your MCP client after saving the configuration. Your agent will now have access to all Breeze tools.

## x402 Integration

The x402 protocol lets your agent access Breeze through a pay-per-call API. Each request is automatically paid for with a ~$0.01 USDC micropayment — **no API key required**.

<Info>
  x402 uses the [Faremeter](https://faremeter.com) payment protocol. Your agent sends a request, receives a `402 Payment Required` response, automatically pays, and retries — all handled transparently.
</Info>

All you need is a Solana wallet with a small USDC balance. The agent handles payments automatically through the `@faremeter/fetch` package.

```typescript
import { payingFetch } from "@faremeter/fetch";
import { Keypair } from "@solana/web3.js";

const keypair = Keypair.fromSecretKey(/* your key */);

// Every call auto-pays with USDC — no API key needed
const response = await payingFetch(
  "https://x402.breeze.baby/deposit/tx",
  keypair,
  {
    method: "POST",
    body: JSON.stringify({
      strategy_id: "your-strategy-id",
      base_asset: "EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v",
      amount: 100,
      user_key: keypair.publicKey.toString(),
    }),
  }
);
```

---

## Skill Integration

A **Skill** is a standalone `SKILL.md` file that teaches any compatible agent framework how to interact with Breeze — no server, no daemon, just a markdown file your agent reads and follows.

The Breeze x402 Payment API skill gives your agent the ability to check balances, deposit, withdraw, and sign/send Solana transactions, all paid automatically via x402 USDC micropayments.

<Info>
  Skills work with agent frameworks that support `SKILL.md` discovery (e.g., Claude Code, custom agent runtimes). The agent reads the skill file, understands the available actions, and executes them autonomously.
</Info>

### How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add the skill to your project">
    Copy the `SKILL.md` file into your project's skills directory:
    ```bash
    mkdir -p skills/breeze-x402-payment-api
    cp path/to/SKILL.md skills/breeze-x402-payment-api/SKILL.md
    ```
    You can find the skill file in the [Breeze Agent Kit repo](https://github.com/anagrambuild/breeze-agent-kit/tree/main/apps/skills/breeze-x402-payment-api).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set environment variables">
    The skill requires a funded Solana wallet and a Breeze strategy ID:
    ```bash
    export WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY="your-base58-private-key"
    export STRATEGY_ID="your-strategy-id"
    # Optional:
    export X402_API_URL="https://x402.breeze.baby"
    export SOLANA_RPC_URL="https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com"
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Ask your agent">
    The agent auto-discovers the skill and handles the rest:
    - *"Check my Breeze balances"*
    - *"Deposit 10 USDC into Breeze"*
    - *"Withdraw 5 USDC from Breeze"*
  </Step>
</Steps>

### What the Skill Covers

The `SKILL.md` contains everything the agent needs:

- **API endpoint contracts** — balance, deposit, and withdraw with full request/response specs
- **Payment setup** — x402 payment-wrapped fetch configuration using `@faremeter/fetch`
- **Transaction signing** — versioned and legacy Solana transaction handling
- **Workflow checklists** — step-by-step instructions for balance, deposit, and withdraw flows
- **Error handling** — HTTP status codes, transaction failures, and security rules
- **Supported tokens** — full mint address and decimal reference table

<Tip>
  The skill uses x402 micropayments (~$0.01 USDC per call) so **no Breeze API key is needed** — just a funded Solana wallet.
</Tip>
